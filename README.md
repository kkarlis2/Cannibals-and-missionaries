The problem of cannibals and missionaries using the
algorithm A* with closed set. You can use heuristics
functions similar to those of the solution to study exercise 4.3 or others
yours (explaining why you chose them in the document you will submit).
Consider that in the initial situation we have N missionaries on one bank
and the same number (N) of cannibals on the same bank but N is a parameter
which is defined when the program is called. The maximum capacity (in
people) of the boat is M, where M is also defined when it is called
program. When calling the program, the
maximum permitted number of river crossings, let K. To
your program should find the optimal solution that does not exceed
the K crossings, if such a solution exists. You can test with
relatively small values of N, M (e.g. 3, 4) and K (e.g. â‰¤ 100). Should
indicate in the document you will submit how much time (depending
and with the computer you are using) your program needs to
to find a solution for the values of N, M, K that you tried, as well as the
corresponding solutions it finds. When M > 2 and there is at least one
missionary in the boat, consider that you must also be inside the boat
the number of cannibals not to exceed the number of missionaries.
